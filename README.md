# Tic-tac-toe
Game
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. 
There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.
Purpose: for players to place their allotted marks (X or O) in a continuous line, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Rules: each player chooses a mark and takes turns to place them on the grid. The game is over when a player gets a continuous line of 3, or the 9-square grid is full.
